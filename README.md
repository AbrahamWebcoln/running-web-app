# running-web-app
I'm from a small town near Brooklyn, Iowa, where Mollie Tibbetts was killed while on a run. My wife is part of a Women's College, and a lot of the young women run alone. I'm developing a web app that allows internal members to notify others that they are going for a run so that there's strength in numbers. True, a Facebook group could do the same thing, but an intranet site is going to be more secure.
